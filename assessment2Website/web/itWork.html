			<h2 class="subtitle"> Interview with </h2>
			<ul class="project_items">
			
			<p><h3>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3></p>
				<p>I’m the CEO of Panopto, a software company that provides a platform for building 
					searchable, cloud-based video libraries, including video capture software for 
					creating the libraries.  I started my career as a software engineer and built the 
					original version of the product; I was CTO of Panopto until 2015 and have been CEO since.  
					Today, I spend my time helping the global, 165-person company stay organized and 
					collaborate effectively across company functions and regions. </p>
				<p><h3>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in. </h3></p>
				<p>We provide Panopto as an enterprise product, meaning that it tends to be sold
					 to institutions rather than individuals.  We primarily sell to the education and
					  corporate markets, though we recently added a new product for individuals.  
					  We spend a lot of time working with universities to develop their video technology 
					  strategies, video-enabled learning models, and accessibility infrastructure. 
					   With large companies, we help CIOs, CLOs, and IT departments define and 
					   launch video-powered learning and communication initiatives. </p>	
					<p><h3>3. Are you able to get more granular? </h3></p>
					<p>Sure, we are a video content management solution. We focus on capturing 
						and delivering media content for a number of enterprise and education 
						customers. We work with varying types of media, we provide an on premise
						 and cloud option with our hosting on AWS servers. This includes a range
						  of database, web and media servers, we have a huge engineering team that
						   manages this globally. That’s where I started. </p>	
					<p><h3>4. You started in engineering? </h3></p>
					<p>Yes, I was actually working for another university when they asked 
						me to help develop a media hosting platform. I took to developing it 
						and the product we have today is just a far more refined version of that. </p>
					<p><h3>5. What other kinds of work do you have to do? </h3></p>
					<p>The role of CEO at a fast-growing tech company is endlessly interesting. 
					 I like to think of my job in simple terms:  my role is to prepare the company 
					 to double in size again.  This means that I need to identify the problems with our
					  current systems, organization structures, and processes that will not scale effectively
					   – whatever form they may take – and figure out how to scale them before we find 
					   ourselves unprepared for the effects of our rapid growth. </p>
					<p><h3> Do you have many interactions with customers? </h3></p>
					<p>I spend a huge amount of time listening to customers and potential 
						customers describe their problems and desires, and for me this is 
						one of the most fun parts of my job. </p>
						<p><h3> 7. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? 
							Please tell us about them.  </h3></p>
						<p>We are still a relatively small company, which means it is 
							still reasonable for me to spend time with people in every role at 
							Panopto.  I spend a lot of time with our senior executive team, of 
							course:  our COO, our CFO, sales leaders, engineering leaders, etc. 
							 But I also try to spend as much time as I can with people in IC and 
							 functional roles – office hours with support technicians, design
							  reviews with product designers and engineering teams, “ride-along”
							calls with salespeople, and so on.  I have also come to view longtime
							Panopto customers, some of which have been with us for more than
							a decade, as “coworkers”, and I’m very fortunate to have been able to
							form working relationships with so many different types of people. </p>
						<p><h3>8. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </h3></p>
						<p>Since we sell a video library platform, a huge part of our sales process 
							involves helping our customers validate their security, architecture, 
							and “use case” requirements.  Most of the people leading these processes
							 are IT professionals or are supported by them.  As a technology company, 
							 this is our world – we live and breathe IT.  Almost every conversation
							  we have with customers is grounded in IT topics or involves workflows 
							  supported by technology.  I really appreciate the strong communication 
							  skills and highly rational thought processes that IT professionals 
							  bring to the table, and I find that these skills make for very 
							  efficient business conversations and problem-solving engagements.</p>
						<p><h3>9. What about your interactions with clients or investors? </h3></p>
						<p>A mentor of mine once said, half-jokingly, that the CEO has four jobs: 
							attracting great employees, defining culture, managing the board, and 
							raising money.  The latter two are really about investment:  managing 
							the expectations and acting on the directives of current investors and 
							working to develop relationships with new ones.  Raising capital is a 
							very complicated process that requires a long lead time, so I spend a 
							lot of time cultivating relationships with capital partners and maintaining 
							their interest in our business.  Panopto is growing at a very nice clip 
							right now – more than 30% per year – so this is a very upbeat story for 
							our investors. </p>
						<p>I spend many hours a week with our clients. 
							Fundamentally, our clients are the experts in what we do – 
							we’re engineers and product designers, not educators or CIOs, 
							so we do our best to listen to their expertise and extrapolate 
							smart product designs from their stories.  Enterprise customers
							 are very demanding and have extremely complex technology challenges,
							 and only by connecting with a lot of them does a picture emerge 
							 of the shared use cases and common themes.  Making time to listen
							  to these customers and learn from them is perhaps the most important 
							  thing we can do to keep Panopto’s products competitive and innovative. </p>
						<p><h3>10. How has covid affected this? </h3></p>
						<p>This hits us in 2 ways, we have a significant increase in 
							cloud usage and I have a company needing to go completely online in a 
							very short period of time. </p>
							<p>Most employees are able to access everything they do remotely, we use
								 so many cloud based products ourselves that everything that user needs
								  should be accessible anywhere. Making the switch to remote work in 
								  just a few days was made possible because of this. </p>
							<p>For the company it meant a huge increase in usage hours, not just
								 recording but viewing content. Servers have to scale far beyond
								  what they usually do, growth at a completely unprecedented rate
								   and having to maintain that on a technical level. </p>
							<p><h3>11. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. </h3></p>
							<p>It is easy to overlook, but my single greatest use of time goes to reading.  
								I get an enormous amount of email, and while I can’t keep up with responses 
								to everything, I really do need to work hard to read all of it so that I
								 stay up to speed on how things are working, how parts of the company are 
								 working together (or not), what customers want, and what is happening in 
								 our market.  Staying informed is the only way I can expect to make sensible 
								 decisions or offer useful guidance. </p>
							<p><h3>12. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </h3></p>
							<p>One of the hardest types of decisions we can make is when or whether 
								to create a new process, rule, system, or automation.  When a start-up 
								begins, there are no processes, rules, or systems; they are created one 
								by one to solve problems.  Creating these structures too early slows a 
								company down in the critical early days; creating them too late keeps 
								a company from scaling and may lead it into chaos in extreme cases. 
								 Working out whether, when, and why we should act to create new 
								 company systems is one of the hardest challenges in scaling an 
								 organization. </p>
							<p><h3>13. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the
								 essence of the IT industry? </h3></p>
								<p>This one is easy:  the mission of the IT industry is solving real-world 
									problems using technology.  The great promise of IT is that it makes 
									things better, and that the technology products continually improve. 
									This continuous improvement is the direct result of thousands of 
									small decisions and interactions that often start with a grouchy 
									social media post or a confused-sounding support ticket, but 
									when the magic works, a software company will tenaciously pursue 
									the source of this unhappiness to understand exactly what is going wrong.
									 I often come away from a product demo or a customer feedback 
									 session with a list of usability improvements and product defects 
									 to address, and pursuing these individual engineering work items 
									 through to resolution – which can only be assessed by the customer, 
									 not by us – is an incredibly gratifying part of working in software. 
									 Making our product better in tiny, incremental, but absolutely 
									 concrete ways is, for me, the essence of working in technology. </p>
