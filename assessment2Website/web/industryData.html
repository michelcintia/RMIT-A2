									<h4>Role Data</h4>
									<p>My original idea of my ideal job was a bit mixed. It was Game developer 
										and Technical Architect. I like the gaming aspect due to my hobby, 
										but after looking at job prospects and burning glass data, I have changed 
										my goal to be solely working towards the job of a Solutions Architect.   </p>
										<p>The same reason as before, SA’s work from multiple perspectives 
											including business, information and technologies to resolve solutions. 
											It will require an understanding in a broad range of topics, an eye on 
											the future and business sense. Solutions Architects are given a 
											lot of managing responsibilities and layout plans for departments to follow. 
											If a company needs to progress their technologies, I would decide on how 
											o implement them and maximise the benefits.  </p>
											<p>I did not realise that it led to the top-ranking job on Burning 
												Glass (Solutions Architect), nevertheless I like the idea to be 
												given a problem or idea, figure it out, implement it and help 
												integrate it into the company.   </p>

					<p><h4>Quantum Researcher </h4></p>
					<p>Quantum technologies are going to create incredible research opportunities throughout the world. 
						Businesses in Australia are set to generate over $4 billion and create 16,000 jobs by 2040. 
						Our Quantum Computing industry is predicted to be worth $2.5B and produce 10K jobs. 
						Globally, quantum technologies are projected to create an estimated $86 billion by 2040 
						(Growing Australia’s Quantum Technology Industry - CSIRO, 2020). </p>
					<p>Quantum research opportunities range in industries from technology companies such as Google, 
						IBM and Microsoft, to the defence, mining and medical sectors. Some examples of how quantum 
						research is used commercially include drug discovery and development, as well as materials 
						development. Research will be enabled by accurate chemical simulations that can be built on 
						a quantum computer. The level of computation in classical computers cannot comprehend the 
						complex structure of most molecules. Quantum technologies are creating stable and highly 
						precise sensors for mineral exploration, water and energy management. Quantum-encryption 
						will enhance security for classified data and communications (Fisher, 2020). </p>
					<p>Many governments are implementing investment programs to develop and expand their quantum 
						industries. Since 2017, at least 5 nations have created billion-dollar scale quantum 
						technology research and development initiatives. China is one of the largest investors, 
						reported to be spending $14.7 billion to build the world’s largest quantum research facility. 
						China has also been in the forefront of quantum research, being the first to create a quantum
						communications satellite and quantum encryption technology (Growing Australia’s Quantum 
						Technology Industry - CSIRO, 2020).</p>
						<p> Companies that employ quantum researchers includes IBM, Intel, Google, Microsoft, 
							Amazon, Lockheed Martin, CSIRO, Archer, Q-CTRL, Silicon Quantum Computing, MOGlabs, 
							D-wave systems, NASA, Quantum Brilliance, Rigetti Computing and QuintessenceLabs. 
							There is a steady number of new venture capital research companies that will emerge 
							and take advantage of this new technology (ltd, 2020).</p>
							<p>Governments all over the world, from the United States, to the UK to Australia, 
								are laying the foundations for a future quantum internet (Ananthaswamy, 2020).</p>
								<h4>Role Data</h4>
								<p>My desire to become a quantum researcher has increased after analysing all 
									the industry data. It was exciting to read CSIRO’s “Growing Australia’s 
									Quantum Technology Industry” 2020 report. Quantum technologies are going to 
									create many avenues for job growth and increase Australia’s economy, injecting 
									a possible $4 billion dollars.  </p>
								<p>Australia’s mining sector will greatly benefit from quantum research. 
									The new materials and drugs that will be made by learning more about the 
									mathematical connections between electrons will be enormous. For example, 
									the simple caffeine molecule is too complex for a classical computer to decipher, 
									but it is hoped a quantum computer will be able to generate an accurate simulation. 
									I’m also interested to see how quantum computers will provide solutions to the 
									environmental sector, helping reverse the effects of climate change, clean up oceans 
									and protect wildlife from extinction.  </p>
								<p>Quantum computing is just getting started. Two decades ago, it was a purely 
									theoretical field. Currently, University of NSW is the only higher education 
									institution in the world that has a degree in quantum computing. </p>
									<p>But as more research and technologies are released for commercial use, 
										including a quantum internet, more interest and investments will be given 
										to quantum computing. The sector will grow and prove to be revolutionary in 
										the next few decades.</p>

			<h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from 
				employers and what are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your 
				required skill set? </h3>
			<p>The programming languages required for our ideal jobs include JAVA and JavaScript,
				which were ranked as the second and third most demanded skill in the IT industry 
				(Labor Insight Skills in Greatest Demand - Burning Glass Technologies, 2018). JavaScript is 
				primarily used by web developers and graphic designers. Where HTML and CSS are languages 
				that give structure and style to websites, JavaScript gives websites interactive elements, 
				making it user friendly. User interface (UI) design also comes into play here. UI design 
				is needed by most companies that have a digital presence. 
				The job of Google UI software developer will require a strong ability in these skills. 
				With the growth of the internet and users, which is estimated to be 4.5 billion in 2020, 
				the demand for more advanced JavaScript and UI design skills will increase in tandem (
					Global digital population hits 4.5 billion, 2020). </p>
			<p>JAVA is used to program a wide variety of products and services, including games such as Minecraft, 
				supercomputers, datacentres and even NASA’s Mars Rover (Reuters, 2020). Java’s popularity 
				is primary due to the exhaustive testing and refinement it has undergone for the last 25 years 
				by a dedicated community of software programmers (Oracle, 2020). Out of the estimated 700 
				programming languages, Java remained the top programming language and will continue to be a 
				highly demanded for many years, however there has been a surge in the use of Python in recent years. 
				The simple and elegant design of Python makes it well suited to the unique demands found within 
				machine learning (ML), automation, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud first software development. 
				Python was demanded by IBM for Quantum research and is used to program their quantum computers on 
				Qiskit (an open source software development kit) and Jupyter Notebook. The C languages have also
				 been requested as a prerequisite for gaming, solutions architecture, quantum computing and 
				 software engineering. Google’s Go language is also another skill that their future employees 
				 may need to possess (The Go Programming Language, 2020). </p>
				 <p>The most demanded skill was knowledge of SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language. 
					 This skill is not in our group’s required skill set. However, it is an ability that employees
					  across all domains will require many IT professionals to understand. According to research
					   by IBM, 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone, 
					   at 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day (IBM software HP, 2020). That data is held in 
					   databases and needs to be retrieved by companies to develop and plan their products and 
					   services. SQL lets a programmer access and manipulate databases. SQL is required to use 
					   relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, 
					   IBM DB2, Teradata and Sybase (DB-Engines Ranking, 2020). RMIT offers a short online course 
					   on SQL.  </p>
					   <p>Link: RMIT SQL: https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/short-courses/courses/s650194-structured-query-language#overview </p>
					<p>Knowledge of SAP software was considered highly desirable in the IT sector. 
						Our group did not have SAP listed as a required skill. SAP stands for System 
						Applications and Products in data processing. SAP software provides helps companies 
						manage complex business processes, with different departments, allowing employees to 
						gain access to real-time insights across their company (What is SAP? - SAP Software, 2020). 
						This ultimately benefits workflows and increases efficiency, productivity and customer service.  </p>
					<p>Project management was listed as the fifth most in-demand skill. The ability to work in 
						a team and coordinate tasks is the foundation of any company’s success. This rare skill 
						is part of our group’s required skill set. The prerequisites to become a successful team 
						leader is not just a high level of organisational and technical knowledge, but also a high 
						degree of social intelligence. The individual must exhibit empathy and become attuned to 
						others’ moods and feelings, as human beings are emotional creatures (Goleman, 2011). 
						The project manager’s ability to understand and organise humans to work cohesively without 
						conflict is often rewarded with larger salary packages due to the complexities involved. </p>
					<p>Employees are also searching for people with skills in Microsoft Windows and Office. 
						It’s become an industry standard platform to work on. While this skill wasn’t specifically 
						requested for any of our ideal jobs, our group does possess a strong understanding of the 
						tools and applications in Windows including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams and OneDrive.  </p>
						<p>Our group’s required IT skill set also includes other in-demand skills including business 
						analysis, systems engineering and customer service. Overall, 
						our required skills are what employees are looking for across the IT sector.
						 We need to develop more skills related to SQL and SAP, whilst also improving our 
						 ability to use Microsoft Windows and Office. </p>
					<h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers 
						and what are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>
						<p>All the in-demand general skills are part of our group’s required skill set. 
							All the companies demanded the top three general skills in their job advertisements. 
							They are looking for individuals who possess a high level of communication skills 
							(articulate and effective English), a proven ability to problem solve and a high degree 
							of organisation. Three of our group’s ideal jobs are in multi-national billion-dollar 
							companies, including Google, IBM, Automation Anywhere. Competition to enter these 
							companies is fierce and as a result, they will only take the most qualified individuals 
							that possess not only knowledge and experience in technical skills, but also several 
							general skills. </p>
						<p>The ability to communicate effectively was ranked as the number one general skill 
							employees are looking for in any IT professional. Writing and verbalising ideas 
							in an articulate and positive manner is a fundamental skill in the science and 
							computer industries, especially as they deal with complex and difficult technical 
							projects daily. Teamwork and collaboration cannot happen without smooth communication. 
							This requires that individuals listen carefully, speak honestly and clearly, be 
							confident and respectful, manage their emotions, give criticism constructively without 
							causing offence and put others at ease. </p>
							<p>This also requires a deep understanding of nonverbal communication, which is 
								conveyed through body language such as facial gestures, body position and tone of voice. 
								In today’s job market, professionals who possess these valuable attributes will have a 
								competitive advantage over other highly technically skilled candidates. </p>
						<p>It will be beneficial for our group to invest time, energy and money into courses 
							that will help increase our communication skills including our social and emotional 
							intelligence. The professional development training company Dale Carnegie offers a 
							range of online courses on topics such as “How to Communicate with Diplomacy and Tact,” 
							“Present Complex Information” and “Successful Public Speaking” (Self-Awareness: 
							Leading with Emotional Intelligence, 2020). Investor Warren Buffet credited the Dale 
							Carnegie course as the key factor in transforming his life and creating billions; 
							“This $100 college course gave me the most important degree I have and it’s why I’m 
							successful today. I don’t have my university degree or diplomas hanging on the wall, 
							but I have this one.” (Gillian Zoe Segal, 2020). </p>
							<p>Problem solving was listed as the second most in-demand general skill. 
								The ability to find solutions to technical problems is the primary job 
								of any IT-professional. Understanding the software capabilities, debugging code,
								 testing and running programs are part and parcel of software programming, 
								 automation, quantum research, solutions architecture and management. 
								 However, the general skill of problem solving refers to the ability to 
								 handle difficult or unexpected situations in the workplace. Individuals 
								 who can calmly access a problem and create solutions are highly valuable
								  to any organisation. This skill requires learning to make logical decisions 
								  (critical thinking) under pressure, researching and active listening. 
								  This capability is particularly useful for Chief Technical Officers and 
								  Solutions Architects, as they are leaders in their organisation and 
								  must take the responsibility to find quick solutions when problems arise.
								Being an excellent problem solver will make candidates stand out among 
								the crowd, as IT companies are constantly looking for people who are 
								trustworthy and dependable in all types of situations (Career Advice - Indeed, 2020). </p>
					<p>Another important general skill to possess is the ability to organise and plan. 
						This involves prioritizing tasks that must be completed immediately, versus those 
						that can be postponed, delegated to another person, or eliminated altogether. 
						Organisation was listed as the third most highly demanded general skill and is a 
						quality all our group’s employees requested. For software programmers, this ability 
						should come naturally, as algorithms are based on the ability to organise structures 
						and create the most efficient route. For quantum research, the ability to organise data 
						and create peer-reviewed research papers requires a great eye for detail, an understanding 
						of critical and analytical thinking, as well as thorough planning. Working in a team on 
						complex scientific problems can only be achieved by delegating tasks and reaching goals 
						in a timely manner. Without structure and order, productivity is slow, if at all existent, 
						and the company’s profitability will suffer. Therefore, all companies are searching for 
						employees that have exemplarily organisational skills. </p>
						<p>Our group’s required general skills also include the ability to lead, troubleshoot, 
							build teams, present, meet deadlines and assure quality and control of products and 
							services. Overall, while studying a formal qualification through RMIT, our group can 
							secure our dream roles by ensuring we’re constantly working on building general skills
							 that will make us an asset to any team. The most important of these skills is 
							 communication – the art of connecting with other employees and collaborating towards 
							 common goals. </p>

							 but it is hoped a quantum computer will be able to generate an accurate simulation. 
							 I’m also interested to see how quantum computers will provide solutions to the 
							 environmental sector, helping reverse the effects of climate change, clean up 
							 oceans and protect wildlife from extinction. Quantum computing is just getting started. 
							 Two decades ago, it was a purely theoretical field. Currently, University of NSW is the 
							 only higher education institution in the world that has a degree in quantum computing. 
							 But as more research and technologies are released for commercial use, including a 
							 quantum internet, more interest and investments will be given to quantum computing. 
							 The sector will grow and prove to be revolutionary in the next few decades. </p>

							<p>After conducting further research into the industry, I have found a limited number 
								of jobs in comparison to other IT fields. However, this field has a very high 
								long-term potential when it comes both to business and career opportunities. 
								According to (Office of the Chief Economist, 2015) it is estimated that 44 percent 
								Australian jobs are highly susceptible to automation. In my personal view this new 
								progressive field is much more appealing and is guaranteed to last for the remainder 
								of my lifetime. </p>
							<h4>Bryce Thomson </h4>
							<p>My original idea of my ideal job was a bit mixed. It was Game developer and 
								Technical Architect. I like the gaming aspect due to my hobby, but after looking 
								at job prospects and burning glass data, I have changed my goal to be solely 
								working towards the job of a Solutions Architect.  </p>
								<p>The same reason as before, SA’s work from multiple perspectives including 
									business, information and technologies to resolve solutions. It will 
									require an understanding in a broad range of topics, an eye on the future
									 and business sense. Solutions Architects are given a lot of managing 
									 responsibilities and layout plans for departments to follow. If a company
									  needs to progress their technologies, I would decide on how to implement 
									  them and maximise the benefits. </p>
								<p>I did not realise that it led to the top-ranking job on Burning Glass 
									(Solutions Architect), nevertheless I like the idea to be given a problem or 
									idea, figure it out, implement it and help integrate it into the company.  </p>
								<h4>Chloe Bradley </h4>
								<p>I’ve been working in the IT industry for about 14 years now. I started in 
									education working for a university and have now moved on to working for a VCMS.
									 My experience in these roles has helped me define where I would like to end up, 
									 a role as Chief Technology Office or Chief Operating Officer, maybe even CEO 
									 of a tech company one day. The industry data only solidifies this as the 
									 correct move for me, IT is a fast paced every changing atmosphere that can 
									 really challenge you but also give fantastic rewards. Being at the forefront 
									 of technology, watching companies explode and take the world by storm. 
									 That is what I want to be there for. </p>
