		<h3> <img src="./img/face.png" alt="Bart"/> Bartlomiej Kubiczek </h3>
		<h2>INTJ – Architect  - 16 Personalities Test</h2>
		<p>Architects put logic before emotion and value truth over opinion, which are very useful and practical traits, 
			but can also hinder relationships among the team, as this personality type may often dismiss opinions and reactions 
			that do not appear rational.</p>
		<p>They like to work alone and out of spotlight when possible, striving for perfection and innovation, 
			which makes them great drivers of growth and creation, that tend to struggle working in a group of people, 
			especially when others are not grasping their concepts or scientific principles behind those.  </p>
			<h2>Learning Style Test - Tactile </h2>
		<p>Tactile or kinesthetic learners learn by touching and doing. Physical movement and “hands-on” 
			experiences that involve building, drawing, and touching allow them to learn the best and the fastest. </p>
		<p>They like to pull things apart, put things together, tinker, improve, optimize, and move around when they 
			do so. Their communication and expression tend to involve a lot of body movement and physical contact as well. </p>
			<h2>Numerical Reasoning Test - 10/10  </h2>
		<p>The 10 out of 10 score simple reveals solid understanding of mathematics and how to create mathematical 
			formulas based on tasks and data provided. It is a great skill to have as an IT engineer. </p>
			<h4>Bart's interpretation of results</h4>
			<p>“To me the results are very accurate in all cases. The first test indicates that I am an "Architect - 
				INTJ-A” characterised by individualism and constant analysis of practically every aspect of life and 
				environment. It is a very rare personality that likes privacy, honesty, truth and rationality. 
				Being assertive and unwavered by opinions of others it's in my opinion a great mindset to achieve goals. 
				The second test indicates a tactile learning type, which gets the most out of their learning through 
				practice. I believe that it's the best learning style for "INTJ", because "Architects" want to utilize 
				their skills practically, be a credible expert or lead with an example. The third test was a verification 
				of numerical reasoning, which in my case is 10/10 for this test. The results are a confirmation of 
				my capabilities for logical thinking and Math skills. In my experience there are positives and 
				negatives when it comes to teamwork for my personality type: </p>
				<ul class="lists">
					<li>Intuitive Learning - <i> Being able to learn fast is a great asset in a team, 
						as I don't need much training, before taking on full responsibilities and can support 
						fellow team members. It is also a downside as communicating terse instructions which 
						seem obvious to me are not always clear to fellow teammates. </i></li>
					<li>Introverted Personality - <i> As an introvert I prefer to focus on my tasks and keep my workflow,
						 which moves collaborative work forward, however that also means that once distracted by 
						 others, it takes me some time to get back into the flow of work.</i> </li>
					<li>Thinking Type - <i>Preference of planning and analysis over going with the feeling is a 
						great way to have any idea worked out to the finest detail, but sometimes little details are 
						not as important and that overanalysis and drilling team with questions can slow down everybody's work.</i>
					 </li>
					<li>Quick Judgment - <i>Being able to make a quick judgment in a high-paced environment is very 
						handy to keep the workflow, however that is often based on preconceived ideas, which can 
						cause people like me to judge their team members to harshly in certain matters.</i> </li>
					<li>Assertiveness - <i>Speaking my mind confidently to team members and the boss is a great asset 
						in communication and helps build rapport with all stakeholders, the only downside is that 
						sometimes important comments from others may be dismissed too early.</i> </li>
					<li>Tactile Learning Style - <i>I like to learn on the job, which is a standard in our competitive 
						economy and allows me to rise to or reach beyond the team's expectations. Learning through 
						practice also means preference of explaining through practice, which might not be suitable 
						when explaining new processes to others, as well as more time consuming. </i></li>
					<li>Great Maths Skills - <i>Every job requires some sort of mathematical abilities and having a 
						team member that can manage their own always makes it easier on the rest of the teammates.</i> </li>

		<h3> <img src="./img/face.png" alt="what"/> Bryce Thomson </h3>
		<h2>16 Personalities Test – ENFP – Campaigner </h2>
		<p>Campaigners are explorers of human connections, however not for the sake of simple excitement and pleasure. 
			They want to improve lives of others, by making them happy through innovative solutions. 
			They tend to be the motivation drivers of the group, however, can have low self-esteem if they cannot 
			contribute any creative solutions. </p>
		<p>They tend to have strong intuition when it comes to human emotion, which makes them very insightful on 
			that part, but also leaves them open to making assumptions. They may be often seen as undecisive or 
			procrastinators if they do not find the career or project that “resonates” with them, but once they do, 
			there is nothing that can stop them from working hard.   </p>
			<h2>Big 5 Personality Test  </h2>
		<p>Openness – 96% - that trait indicates how open the person is to abstract and complex ideas. 
			Bryce’s score indicates that he is very creative and adventurous. He is very likely to enjoy art and 
			is likely to explore the unconventional and seek the unusual.  </p>
		<p>Conscientiousness – 42% - indicates how likely a person is to put off the immediate pleasure 
			for the long-term gain. Bryce’s score would indicate that he is likely to seize the day and focus on 
			short-term goals.  </p>
			<p>Extraversion – 69% - describes how inclined the person is to seek stimulation through 
				engagement with other people. Bryce’s score would suggest that he will thrive more by creating 
				exciting friendships, passionate relationships and receiving social recognition. </p>
				<p>Agreeableness – 79% - shows how likely the person is to be empathetic and put needs of others 
					before their own. Bryce’s score suggests that he takes more pleasure from helping others than 
					winning in a competition.  </p>
					<p>Neuroticism – 65% - indicates person’s tendency to experience sadness, anxiety, 
						and other negative emotions. Bryce’s score would suggest that he is likely to feel 
						strong emotions in relation to his personal or observed misfortune, danger, etc.  </p>

			<h2>Learning Style Test – Visual </h2>
			<p>Visual learners learn through reading and observation and are very responsive to colors. They are the most likely to have color-coded notes as they like tend to be the neat and clean. They tend to visualize what they are learning or need to recall from memory. 

				They tend to focus on tasks and entertainment that involve visual stimulus and may have 
				difficulties with spoken directions. </p>

				<h4>Bryce's interpretation of results</h4>
				<p><i>“According to the 16-personality test, I am a Campaigner. I agree with this description of 
					being (slightly) extraverted, intuitive, a lot of feelings and prospecting. 
					I embrace ideas and hope for a better world for us to live in. I am not too stuck in a 
					dreaming state, which my Big 5 personality suggests. I do think I am practical as well. 
					Which is reflected on my thinking analysis. I am more of an empathetic idealist mixed with 
					analytical thinker. </i></p>
					<p></p>
					<p><i>I use insight and creativity to help others, connecting seemingly unrelated ideas. 
						Creating something new but sometimes too abstract, which would have a negative effect 
						on others. Maybe confusing and/or misleading discussions, or brainstorming exercises. 
						I would have to find a team that has a similar capability for abstract thought. 
						Or I will have to restrain the extent of my big ideas and bring in more feasible goals. 
						In a group, I will have to find a balance of expressing my idealist ideas and communicating 
						them, with being practical. </i>
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<p><i>I tend to be impulsive and easily side-tracked. I agree with the impulsiveness, 
						which goes hand in hand with getting “side-tracked”, but to the extent of that I 
						like new ideas and want to explore a lot of them. I do keep in mind of what will be good 
						for me/ the group in the future, so what we do in the present should be planned and built 
						towards a goal. I will have to be mindful of how many ideas I pursue and/or encourage in a 
						group, quickly agreeing on one path and following it.</i> </p>
						<p></p>
						<p><i>I am extraverted and Agreeable. I do put people's needs above my own more often 
							than not, which I think translates really well in a group environment. 
							Listening and pursuing others' thoughts are statistically relevant, but I do like to 
							hold strong on the ideas that are important, when it comes down to a debate. I engage a 
							lot with people, seeking their approval and the emotional payoff. I think this is a 
							detriment to my personality because I think I need to do what is objectively right and 
							not based on emotions that are sporadic. With these attributes, I believe I could fit 
							into any group with initializing communications, attentive listening and being supportive.” </i></p>

			<h2>Four Tendencies Test – Rebel  </h2>
		<p>This “tendency” indicates strong independence, which can range from assertive individualism to

			<h4>Chloe's interpretation of results</h4>
			<p>
				<i>“I am a Visual Learning, ENFP-T, whose dominant tendency based on Gretchin Rubin's Four Tendencies. </i>
			</p>
				<p>
					<i>This makes me a hands-on learning who needs things written on board or shown through a video or 
					guided through during a remote session. I learn by doing, I can see this reflected in the way 
					I'm learning so far as I track along with the tutors during our classes. I understand why my 
					answers gave me rebellious tendencies, the definition of this is that you aren't influenced by 
				internal or external factors meaning it can be difficult to find a motivator when you're only trying to please another
				person. Lucky this behavior and getting older has taught me a great trick for dealing with this lack of motivation, 
				and that is by using competition. But not competition against others, competition against myself. </i></p>
				<p><i>This actually now makes me incredibly useful in a group, I speak where required but take orders 
					really well as I know the benefits of the team far outweigh the benefits of the few, and everyone 
					achieving something and bettering themselves is positive internal competition. Be able to motivate 
					and self-motivate, lead and know when to be led, helps me work with my team to achieve greatness.”</i></p>

							<h4>Cintia's interpretation of results</h4>
							<p><i>My personal profile pointed me as an Advocate on 16 Personalities Test.

								guide them in all things. </i></p>

								lasting positive impact. People with this personality type tend to be seen 
								helping others as their purpose in life. As they can easy make connections to others, 
								they have a talent for warm, sensitive language, speaking human terms rather than 
								pure logic and fact. </i></p>
								<ul class="lists">
									<li> Creative: <i> Advocates are very creative solving problems, people with 
										these characteristics enjoy helping people to find the perfect solution 
										for their problems, which makes them excellent advisors or counsellors.</i></li>
									<li> Insightful: <i>Advocates are very straight to the point in terms of problems, 
										they prefer a honest discussion than trying to manipulate someone.</i></li>
									<li>Decisive: <i>Advocates use their creativity to follow their ideas with 
										conviction and use their willpower to plan the necessary steps to go through 
										their projects.</i></li>
								</ul>
								<p><i>The Vark modalities test 

									Vark Questionnaire is a learning preferences test. My Results were: </i></p>

										<li><i>Visual: 8 </i></li>
										<li><i>Aural: 1 </i></li>
										<li><i>Read/write: 8</i> </li>
										<li><i>Kinesthetic: 12</i> </li>
									</ul>
									<p>This means my learning preference was mild Kinesthetic which is 
										people with preferences for practical exercises, experiences, examples, 
										case studies; things that are tangible. Researching about kinesthetic learners, 
										I found out it is related to physical memory, they learn best through hands on 
										activities and they are good at remembering things they have done before, e.g.: 
										cooking classes, putting together computers, jigsaw puzzles, etc. Some tips for 
										kinesthetic learners are use of flash cards which use lots of the visual memory, 
										study in short blocks and short breaks (pomodoro method), write down study notes, 
										visual maps, etc. </p>
										<p><i>Big 5 personality test After taking this test, my scores were:</i> </p>
										<ul class="lists">
										<li>Openness 94%: People with tendency to think in abstract, complex ways.
											 They tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. Openness is 
											 usually related to a person’s interest in art and culture. </li>
										<li>Conscientiousness 67%: ability to exercise self-discipline and control. </li>
										<li>Extraversion 37%: Inclination to seek stimulation others. </li>
										<li>Agreeableness 54%: Tendency to put other’s priorities ahead of their own. 
											They are good dealing with empathy and tend to be trusting and forgiving. </li>
										<li>Emphatic idealist: uses insight and creativity to help people around them. 
											Thinks about how the world could be a better place. </li>
											<li>Analytical Thinker: Solves logical problems with rational, 
											complex analysis. Thinks about innovative ways to improve systems. </li>
											<li>Logical mechanic: Ensures accuracy and efficiency in logical systems. 
												Uses proven methods to accomplish real world goals. </li>
											<li>They are very creative and imaginative and often see things that others
											 do not. They have unusual ideas and they are not afraid to point out what is wrong. </li>
											<li>They love new ideas, and value originality, creativity, and imagination.
											 It is important for them to learn new things and improve their mind. </li>
										</ul>
										<p><i>Personality and learning styles tests are a great way to know more about 
											yourself and your thinking style. It can help people to discover their 
											best learning style and apply some methods while studying. 
											It was pleasant to read about the Myers-Briggs test which brought me 
											some insights about my own personality as I totally agree 
											I am an Advocate type of person; I am the one who does things because 
											they have a purpose, I rarely do something just for doing it or because 
											someone asked me for. I believe that I would be more than happy if 
											my work would generate a positive impact around me. Also, discovering 
											that I am kinesthetic learner makes total sense as I always need to put 
											my hands on something to understand how that works, I usually 
											make associations with real life things in order to make my brain
											 retain the information easily. That would help me so much in my studies,
											  so I do not waste time in learning methods that are not favorable to 
											  my learning style.</i> </p>
											  <p><i>I think when working in teams I would make a positive impact as I 
												  am always trying to get the best from people, and I am probably 
												  be the one that is going to encourage others to keep the work going 
												  and creating a cooperative environment. I have been learning from 
												  group work and I believe the best way to keep the group on the track 
												  is to communicate with your colleagues and keep things crystal clear.
												   Teamwork can be challenging sometimes but it also can be very 
												   rewarding as if you meet colleagues with similar aspirations, 
												   you can keep working together for a long time and also learn and 
												   teach in a collaborative group. To form a team, it is nice to 
												   have people like-minded, as things become easier when people 
												   agree about their goals and responsibilities. Even in distance 
												   learning classes, it is easier to see people with similar ideas 
												   as yours, so that would help both sides to keep a good relationship
													when studying and collaborating. Also, finding friendly 
													people where you can share your strengths and weakness, 
													you can learn together and develop your project without 
													too much stress and problems.”</i> </p>

			<h2>Honey & Humford Learning Style Test – Pragmatist  </h2>
		<p>This personality type is strongly grounded in reality and likes the material they are learning to 
			be proven with an example or that the application of thereof is observable in real world. 
			They do not like exploring concepts that are abstract and cannot be applied. </p>
		<p>They are problem solvers who enjoy experimentation, new theories and techniques that are clearly beneficial.  </p>

			<h2>Helen Fisher Personality Test – Director  </h2>
		<p>This personality type is ambitious, competitive, and they excel in tasks that require analysis and strategy.
			 Directors tend to be apt in skills that require understanding of patterns and structures, 
			 such as Computer Science, Engineering, Math, etc.  </p>
			 <p>They treat their personal relationships the same as everything with analysis and tend to make 
				 decisions and actions that are more calculative than emotional, because of that they tend to align 
				 themselves with more agreeable and emotionally open counterparts.  </p>
				 <h4> Dhilrukshi's interpretation of results</h4>
				 <p><i>I am an Advocate INFJ-A (Assertive) Personality: Johann Von Goethe once said, 
					 “Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what 
					 they are capable of being.” This quote (which was displayed on the results page) sums up 
					 how I wish people treated others. I know everyone is here for a reason and that they are enough. 
					 They can reach their highest desires if they pursue their goals with determination and persistence.
					  But most people never realise their dreams because they let others destroy their confidence 
					  and self-worth. As a result, the world never benefits from their creative minds. A perfect 
					  example of this is Alan Turing, the father of modern computers and artificial intelligence. 
					  He was abused at school and by authorities for being homosexual, and later committed suicide. 
					  Imagine how advanced computers would be if he had lived a long life. </i></p>
					  <p><i>I generally fit into the Advocate personality type, as they want an egalitarian world 
						  and are motivated by purpose and meaning, as opposed to material gain and status. 
						  That's why I'm learning about computers. One day I can use it to solve problems like 
						  disease or pollution. The results showed that I am 51% introverted. I found this 
						  interesting because I expected to be around 80% introverted, as I'm quite independent 
						  and love spending time alone. I am 52% intuitive, which I agree with. I often use my 
						  imagination and like thinking about the future, although I am also practical and realistic 
						  in achieving a goal. </i></p>
						  <p><i>The test also showed I was 60% feeling, meaning that I use feelings more often 
							  than logical thought to make a decision. I respect logical thinking and understand 
							  the biological reason why we have gut instincts. The subconscious mind takes in far 
							  more information than the conscious mind and sends that data to us via feelings. 
							  Many people have experienced feeling uneasy around certain individuals, only to 
							  find out later that the person was dangerous, abusive, or mentally unwell. 
							  Our species has evolved to pick up subtle body movements and facial expressions 
							  that are expressed to us through negative feelings. These feelings can guide us 
							  through life, helping us make better, faster decisions, especially in 
							  life-threatening situations.5 </i></p>
							  <p><i>Team Dynamic: I am open to other people's ideas and treat people as equals,so I'll 
								  play fairly in a team. I will do my share of the work and help others who need it.
								   I am 89% judging as opposed to prospecting, which means I need things to be very 
								   organised, structured and planned. This may lead to problems with other team 
								   members who are more spontaneous and opportunistic. They may like to improvise 
								   while I like things to be predictable and clear. I need to be more flexible 
								   and allow for changing ideas. I am assertive and confident most of the time, 
								   so will speak my thoughts and want to be heard. I have to take care not to 
								   speak over others or interrupt them. The test said I was a diplomat, 
								   so I should be able to cooperate and harmonize with others well. </i></p>
								   <p>The Honey & Mumford learning style test results:<i> My Primary Learning style: Pragmatic/Theorist/Reflector: 

									I am equal parts (27.7%) pragmatic, theorist, and reflector. 
									I am only 16.9% activist, which I disagree with because I love learning by doing. 
									That is why I am studying electrical circuits through a Certificate 2 - 
									it's very hands on. I agree I am pragmatic and enjoy doing things in the 
									real world to truly understand a subject. I learn best when fully immersed 
									in a subject - eating, breathing, and sleeping it.</i> </p>
									<p><i>For example, I studied French in a classroom for 4 years and can barely 
										string a sentence together. However, by the time I was four, I could 
										understand Tamil and speak it fluently because my parents spoke it every day.
										Most children can do this because humans are naturally wired to learn 
										through imitation.11 If school and university courses were like 
										apprenticeships, students would learn at a greater speed and retain more 
										knowledge. I agree that I love to experiment with new ideas and techniques 
										to see if they work. I was always tempted to take things apart and 
										understand how they work. Being curious is important to understanding a 
										subject on a deeper level.</i></p>
										<p><i>The results also said I am a theorist. This is a personality trait I 
											wish everyone could have, as the world be more peaceful if everyone 
											thought in an objective and logical manner. Too many people are irrational 
											and base their decisions on zero evidence. I like to understand and make
											 decisions based on information and fit things into rational order. </i></p>
										<p><i>Lastly, I am a reflector. I agree that I tend to be cautious and 
											observe what is going on. I like to do things carefully and analyse 
											information before making conclusions. I often analyse my thoughts and 
											actions and try see the whole forest, not just the trees. That way I 
											am thinking broadly instead of being narrow minded. I enjoy being 
											coached by people who give me insight into my behavior. It's important 
											for me to improve as a person. </i></p>
											<p> </p>
											<p>Team Dynamic: <i>I think my learning style perfectly suits working 
												with others as I like to gain new perspectives. Everyone is a 
												teacher and if you want to learn, they will teach you something. 
												It's a great way to improve yourself. I think logically and, in 
												this respect, understand it is advantageous to collaborate. 
												A branch of mathematics called game theory elegantly explains 
												how entities have an incentive to naturally cooperate, where 
												cooperation is a Nash equilibrium - a situation where any party 
												would be worse off if they altered their strategy.20 </i></p>
											<p>The Helen Fisher neuro-chemical-based personality test results: My primary personality type is 
												Director: The results state that my brain is testosterone dominant. I'm 95% of the Director 
												personality. Women usually don't have the male sex hormone testosterone flooding their brain 
												system. They usually have the female sex hormone estrogen instead. This is why women tend to 
												make up most of the nursing and counselling roles in society.16 And most men fill the roles 
												for engineering and mathematical jobs, as testosterone has been linked with higher spatial/mathematical 
												abilities.9 A possible reason why Alan Turing committed suicide may be due to the female hormones 
												he was forced to take as a 'cure' for homosexuality. It may have reduced his ability to perform 
												complex mathematics. </p>
												<p>But there are exceptions to the rules. There are many women 
													who successfully contribute to highly technical fields. 
													According to anthropologist Helen Fisher, people who have 
													a director personality are very analytical and strategic 
													thinkers. They are tough minded and rarely get emotional. 
													I agree with this completely. I rarely cry and have a thick skin. 
													I love learning about math, computers, mechanics, and engineering. 
													I'm ambitious and driven to master difficult complex subjects.
													 If something is easy, I tend to get bored and lose interest. 
													 I'm very skeptical and like to see the facts instead of anecdotal 
													 evidence. I've always been a Tomboy. </p>

		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p>As a team we have the advantage of coming from various cultural and ethnical backgrounds, 
			as well possess a range of different life experiences. Normally that can lead to issues in communication, 
			however when well applied it allows us to understand many different demographics and their needs, 
			while minimizing or blind spots.  </p>
		<p>We are all self-motivated, as each person in the group has been intentionally acquiring IT skills 
			regardless of their professional IT career. Majority of the group has working experience within the 
			industry which further contributes to our overall capabilities.  </p>
		<p>Our team profiles reveal very interesting facts about our personalities and how they can affect the 
			team dynamics, however the entire team is aware that it these are not definite statements that we should 
			follow, but indications that can help us refine our teamwork.  </p>
		<p>Looking at the test results we have a lot of strong personalities in our team and the entirety of the 
			group strives to achieve either a greater goal or a greater good, which has allowed us to build a strong 
			momentum ahead of deadlines and refinement of communication over time. We are all focused on the task, 
			value truth, communication, efficiency, and hard work which has allowed us to smoothly divide the tasks. 
			swiftly recover from a loss of team member along the way.   </p>
		<p>Having majority of the group members suitable for leadership also means that even with a loss of current 
			team “manager” or member, the team can quickly recover and complete the assignments before deadline.  </p>
			 <p>All group members are either visual or kinesthetic learners, which are very suitable styles for IT 
				 and will allow us all to thrive in the field. The only downside of it is that we do not have a 
				 great grasp on auditory learners and our project might not cater to them as well as to the other 
				 types of learners.  </p>
